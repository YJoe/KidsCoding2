                    central Reading and aims to provide local children (aged 9-14) with free access
                    to after- school clubs where they can learn the foundations of computer programming.
                </p>
                <p class = "bodyText">These clubs are run by our enthusiastic volunteers and managed
                    by our employees who encourage the kids to aim high and be creative, as well as
                    providing them with a new, sought after skill at an early age the sessions improve
                    the children’s confidence and give them a greater connection with an ever changing
                    world, and potentially a new, useful hobby.
                </p>
                <p class = "bodyText">Kids Coding run their ‘coding clubs’ at local schools. The schools
                    provide the resources which are key to the children's learning. To sign up your
